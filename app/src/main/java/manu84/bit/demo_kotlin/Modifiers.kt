//Modifiers are: public, private, protected, internal, open

//private class is accessible inside a file and private members are accessible only inside the block
//in which they are declared.

//internal modifier is a kotlin feature, it make the field visible only inside the module in which it
//implemented.

//In kotlin all classes are final by default, so they cannot inherit by default. To make a class
//inheritable the open keyword has to be used. This keyword makes a function overrideable.

//protected modifier makes fields accessible inside a block, a class or a subclass.
